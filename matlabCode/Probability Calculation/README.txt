This folder contains all files nescesary to calculate:
1) The probability of K discoveries in an individual discovery period
1) The expected value of K as a function of theta
3) The CDF of N_DCT, the discovery completion time

To run these files you need both the folder AData(a zip of this folder 
is included) and the file pColData.txt(included). More values for these can 
be created using:
1) ~\matlab\Probability Simulations\single round\aDataGetter.m for AData 
files(which must be put into a folder called AData)
2) ~\matlab\Probability Simulations\single round\pColDataMaker.m for 
pColData.txt
