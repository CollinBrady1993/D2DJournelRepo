Due to Github's file size limits we are not able to upload the entire AData
folder at once. This folder is important for both the "Probability 
Calculation" and "NS3 Validation" code.

to accomidate the file size limits we have split the data into two zip 
files, AData(1-22).zip and AData(23-24).zip. To feconstruct the AData 
folder please unzip both and combine their contents into a single folder, 
"AData", then place that folder in both the "Probability Calculation" and 
"NS3 Validation" folders.
